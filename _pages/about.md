I am an applied research scientist and an ex-software engineer with a decade of ex-
perience in research and development. My background ranges from machine learning,

network science, scalable data mining, and predictive modeling. I have pioneered sev-
eral novel computational tools to model and analyze graph-based spreading processes.

In my Ph.D. and postdoc, I became an expert in developing end-to-end solutions lever-
aging real-world data.
