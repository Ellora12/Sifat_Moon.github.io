I am an applied research scientist and an ex-software engineer with a decade of ex-
perience in research and development. My background ranges from machine learning,

network science, scalable data mining, and predictive modeling. I have pioneered sev-
eral novel computational tools to model and analyze graph-based spreading processes.

In my Ph.D. and postdoc, I became an expert in developing end-to-end solutions lever-
aging real-world data.




Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
